Promotional html

This project was based on an email I received from Nordstrom Rack.
I used the Foundation for emails frame-work this allowed me to cut down the time it takes to do an Html email.
This email presented a challenge to get some of the alignment on the text but help me to learn some valuable insight.
Foundation includes a gulp file that has production build and browser-sync for live-reload.
I checked this project in Mail Chimp and my personal email for quality.
